# MagicNumberCalculator
A simple web page for calculating a sports team's magic number

## Overview
In sports, the magic number is an indication of how close a team is to clinching a playoff spot or division best record.

It is calculated in terms of the wins and loses of two teams and the total number of games in a season. When the megic number reaches 0, the "other team" is mathmatically incapable surpassing a team.

The formula to calculate the magic number of Team A with (dis)respect to Team B is:

Games In A Season + 1 - Team A Wins - Team B Losses
